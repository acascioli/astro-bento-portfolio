# Hosting My Personal Website on the Dark Web with a Raspberry Pi 5 and Astro

Hello, fellow tech enthusiasts and curious minds! After diving deep into Astro for building my personal website, I felt the itch to explore beyond the conventional web and venture into the depths of the dark web. Thanks to [NetworkChuck’s tutorial](https://academy.networkchuck.com/blog/create-your-own-dark-web-website), I was able to achieve this exciting challenge using my Raspberry Pi 5. Here's a step-by-step account of my journey, from setting up the hardware to making my site accessible on the dark web.


## The Setup: Raspberry Pi 5 and Astro

### 1. Getting Started with Raspberry Pi 5

First things first, I needed to get my Raspberry Pi 5 up and running. I followed the standard setup procedure:

- **Download and Install OS**: I downloaded the Raspberry Pi Imager and flashed the latest Raspberry Pi OS onto a microSD card.
- **Initial Configuration**: I booted up the Pi, completed the initial setup—including network configuration, SSH, SFTP, and system updates.

### 2. Building the Website with Astro

Astro, with its modern approach to building static sites, made it easy to create a sleek and fast website. Here’s a brief overview of what I did:

- **Set Up Astro**: I initialized a new Astro project by running

```bash
pnpm create astro@latest
```

- **Develop the Website**: Using Astro’s components and markdown support, I crafted my personal website. I focused on a clean, minimal design to ensure fast load times. I used view transitions for the blog and a React island for customized shortcuts.
- **Build and Test Locally**: Once my site was ready (or so I thought), I generated the static files and previewed the site locally.

### 3. Hosting the Website Locally

To host the website locally on the Raspberry Pi, I used **Nginx**. On Debian-based systems, you can install it with

```bash
apt install nginx
```

As soon as the installation is complete, the web server is up and running without any additional configuration.

To host our static website, copy the website folder into _/var/www/_. Once done, edit the Nginx default site configuration by modifying the file _/etc/nginx/sites-available/default_. Look for the line _root /var/www/[dist]_.

Before restarting the service with, it’s a good practice to test the configuration with

```bash
nginx -t
```

## Transitioning to the Dark Web

### 1. Setting Up Tor

To host a website on the dark web, you need Tor. Here’s how I set it up, following NetworkChuck’s guide:

- **Install Prerequisites**: To enable all package managers using the libapt-pkg library to access metadata and packages over HTTPS:
  ```bash
  apt install apt-transport-https
  ```
- **Add Tor’s Repository and Install It**:

  - Check your OS version:

  ```bash
  cat /etc/debian_version
  ```

  - Add Tor’s repository to the sources list:

  ```bash
  nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tor.list
  ```

  In the file, add the following two lines of code, replacing _"distribution"_ with your Debian version:

  ```bash
  deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org <DISTRIBUTION> main

  deb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org <DISTRIBUTION> main
  ```

  - Add the GPG key used to sign the packages by running:

  ```bash
  wget -qO- https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | gpg --dearmor | tee /usr/share/keyrings/deb.torproject.org-keyring.gpg >/dev/null
  ```

  If you encounter issues (as I did), refer to [Tor project’s support](https://support.torproject.org/apt/).

  - Install Tor and the Tor Debian keyring:

  ```bash
  apt update
  apt install tor deb.torproject.org-keyring
  ```

### 2. Configuring Tor

Unlike Nginx, Tor doesn’t automatically start hosting anything. You need to modify the file _/etc/tor/torrc_. Specifically, uncomment these two lines:

```bash
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80
```

We’re almost in party mode! Now, retrieve your **onion address** and restart the Tor service to get things rolling:

```bash
cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname

systemctl restart tor
```

### 3. Extra Fun: Vanity Onion Address

It already feels great to have accomplished this small project. Nonetheless, I decided to go further and create a _Vanity Onion Address_. Here’s how:

- **Install mkp224o**:
  - Install Prerequisites:
  ```bash
  apt install gcc libc6-dev libsodium-dev make autoconf
  ```
  - Clone the Git repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/cathugger/mkp224o.git
  ```
  - From the mkp224o directory:
  ```bash
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  ```
- **Generate a New Key**:

  ```bash
  ./mkp224o chuck -v -n 1 -d ~/supremeonionkey -t 4
  ```

  > Replace "chuck" with your desired key.<br/> > _I intentionally left the reference to Chuck._

- **Copy the Key to the Hidden Service Directory**:
  ```bash
  cp * /var/lib/tor/hidden_service
  ```
- **Restart Tor**:
  ```bash
  systemctl restart tor
  ```

## Conclusion

Hosting a personal website on the dark web was an exhilarating challenge, blending modern web technologies with advanced privacy measures. My Raspberry Pi 5 handled the task brilliantly, and the process taught me a lot about both web development and cybersecurity. If you're up for a unique project, give it a try—just be sure to follow best practices for security and privacy!
